Description:
This document is a compilation of the responses to
the survey 'What is your impression of Kiruna?'
From the citizens' responses to this last part of the
survey, it is evident that certain buildings, such as
the Kiruna Church, the Hjalmar Lundbohmsgården,
and the Town Hall, are considered of significant
value to the population. The municipality views the
experience of this survey positively, to the extent
that over the years it will propose various consultation
opportunities.

Description:
The Detailed Overview Plan is one of the three planning
instruments available to Swedish administrations
and represents an intermediate scale. Like the
Overview Plan, compliance with it is not mandatory,
but it serves as a supporting plan for Detailed Plans,
sharing the characteristic of regulating a specific
area of the Kiruna municipality rather than its entire
extent, as the Overview Plan does. This specific plan
focuses on the central area of Kiruna and its
surroundings, incorporating all the projections of
the Development Plan into a prescriptive tool.
