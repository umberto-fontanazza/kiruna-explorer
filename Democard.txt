Description:
This document is a compilation of the responses to
the survey 'What is your impression of Kiruna?'
From the citizens' responses to this last part of the
survey, it is evident that certain buildings, such as
the Kiruna Church, the Hjalmar Lundbohmsgården,
and the Town Hall, are considered of significant
value to the population. The municipality views the
experience of this survey positively, to the extent
that over the years it will propose various consultation
opportunities.

This document is the update of the Development
Plan, one year after its creation, modifications are
made to the general master plan, which is published
under the name 'Adjusted Development
Plan91,' and still represents the version used today
after 10 years. Certainly, there are no drastic differences
compared to the previous plan, but upon careful
comparison, several modified elements stand out.
For example, the central square now takes its final
shape, as well as the large school complex just north
of it, which appears for the first time.
