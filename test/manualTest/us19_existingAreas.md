# Manual Test Scenarios for User Story 19

## As a Urban Planner I want the option to select an existing point or areas instead of drawing a new one So that georeferencing is more consistent and faster to define

### Scenario 1.1: Define the georeferencing of a document on the map, with existing area

- Type of user: Urban Planner
- Precondition: User is logged in as an Urban Planner [Scenario 1.1 User Story 1]
- Post condition: A form for entering the details of the new document is displayed
